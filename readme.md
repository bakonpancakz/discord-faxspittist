`FaxSpittist` is a motivational Discord Bot designed to keep its users happy and motivated.


## Steps on Hosting `FaxSpittist`

1. Clone This repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Set the environment variable `TOKEN_FAXSPIT` to your very own **Bot Token**. 
4. `npm start`

## ❓ Interactions
`FaxSpittist` automatically sets its global interactions on startup. 

If you do not see the commands, I recommend kicking and reinviting your bot again, forcing Discord to refresh the global interactions.

Note: Considering we are using interactions, no permissions are required for `FaxSpittist` to operate.
